# CRUDdemo
This a basic CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete)Operations done by using SpringBoot and MySQL WorkBench as the Backend support. For the Frontend support I have used Thymeleaf
dependency in springboot which creates the HTML template. This HTML template is used for creating a web application which further acts as a interface for enhancing CRUD 
operations.
